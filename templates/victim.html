			<p>18 August 2016:</p>
			<p>I felt really sad when I was cyberbullied. Nasty pictures of me were posted online by my friend. However, I have sought help from Ellis,
			I have managed to solve my problem. I have felt very happy every since :D

			<p>13 August 2016:</p>
			<p>Through some close friends, I discovered that there were some people who were taking photos of me and spreading rumours,
			hurtful words and unflattering comments. After speaking to the counsellor, I have managed to find ways to deal with this problem
			by speaking up more. Now, I'm glad that the cyber bullying has finally stopped.</p>

			<p>5 August 2016:</p>
			<p>It was really hurtful when I was being cyber bullied. Another student impersonated me on social media. All my friends lost trust
			in me for the period of time when they thought that I was the one posting the comments. However, the counsellor told me to 
			keep a positive outlook and to clear the misunderstandings with my friends. As for the people who don't me, I understand that it is 
			easy to judge before we know the truth. With the support of my <em>true</em> friends, I managed to cope with the easy loss of trust and 
			forgive the people who decided to impersonate me. From my experience, my advice is not to succumb to a pessimistic outlook and
			be more confident of yourself. If friends lose trust in you so easily, then perhaps they are not the friends for you.</p>
